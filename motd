The plastic world won
The layout turned out to be stronger
The last boat is cold
The last flashlight is tired,
       and lumps of memories snort in my throat

         Oo- my defense
         Glass eye sunbeam
         Oo- my defense
         The funeral ball of an absurd world
         The funeral ball of the cheap world
